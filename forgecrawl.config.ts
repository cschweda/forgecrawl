/**
 * forgecrawl.config.ts — Single source of truth for all public configuration.
 *
 * This file controls every non-secret setting in ForgeCrawl. When you deploy,
 * these are the values baked into the build. You should never need to duplicate
 * these defaults in .env, nuxt.config.ts, or individual source files.
 *
 * SECRET VALUES (auth secrets, encryption keys, API credentials) belong in
 * .env — never in this file. See .env.example for the template.
 *
 * USAGE:
 *   In packages/app/nuxt.config.ts:
 *     import { config, toRuntimeConfig } from '../../forgecrawl.config'
 *
 *   Then set runtimeConfig: toRuntimeConfig()
 *
 * STRUCTURE:
 *   The file is organized into two sections:
 *     1. COMMON — Settings most users will want to review or change
 *     2. ADVANCED — Defaults that work for most deployments; change only
 *        if you understand the implications
