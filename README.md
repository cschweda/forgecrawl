# ForgeCrawl

Self-hosted, authenticated web scraper that converts website content into clean Markdown optimized for LLM consumption.

## Why ForgeCrawl?

LLMs work best with clean, structured text — not raw HTML full of navigation, ads, and scripts. ForgeCrawl gives you a private, self-hosted tool to scrape any public webpage and get back clean Markdown with metadata, ready to feed into your AI workflows.

### Who is this for?

- **Researchers** building knowledge bases from government reports, academic pages, or institutional websites that don't have APIs
- **Developers** creating RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) pipelines who need clean, structured content from the web
- **Content teams** archiving web content as Markdown for documentation, migration, or LLM fine-tuning datasets
- **Policy analysts** scraping legislative sites, agency reports, and public records into a format AI tools can actually use
- **Anyone** who's tired of copy-pasting web content into ChatGPT and losing all the formatting

### Real-world examples

| Use case | What you'd scrape | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| **Build a research corpus** | 200 pages from a state agency website | Clean Markdown files with metadata (dates, authors, canonical URLs) ready for a RAG pipeline |
| **Feed context to an LLM** | A long technical doc or policy page | Structured Markdown you can paste directly into Claude, GPT, or any LLM prompt |
| **Archive a blog** | Individual blog posts from a company site | Markdown with YAML frontmatter preserving publication dates, authors, and descriptions |
| **Create training data** | Product pages, FAQ sections, support docs | Consistently formatted Markdown suitable for fine-tuning or embedding generation |
| **Monitor content changes** | A regulatory page that updates quarterly | Re-scrape with cache bypass to get the latest version in a diffable format |

### Why not just use Firecrawl / Jina / etc.?

- **Self-hosted** — your data never leaves your server. No API keys, no usage limits, no third-party dependencies.
- **Free** — no per-page pricing. Scrape as much as you want on your own infrastructure.
- **Authenticated** — built-in user auth means you can deploy it on a public server without worrying about unauthorized access.
- **Simple** — one Docker command or PM2 start. No Redis, no Postgres, no message queue. SQLite handles everything.

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete

Phase 1 (Foundation & Auth) is fully implemented and tested. The app is functional for single-URL HTTP scraping with built-in authentication.

### What Works Now

- First-run admin registration (one-time `/setup` flow)
- Login/logout with JWT sessions (configurable 15-day expiry)
- Single-URL scraping via HTTP fetch
- Content extraction (Mozilla Readability with full-body fallback)
- HTML-to-Markdown conversion (Turndown + GFM)
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (canonical URL, description, timestamps, etc.)
- Result caching (configurable TTL, bypass option)
- Scrape history with detail view
- Copy to clipboard and download as `.md`
- Delete scrapes
- Sitemap detection (notification only — crawling is Phase 3)
- Auto `https://` prefix on URLs
- SSRF protection (private IPs, localhost, cloud metadata, DNS resolution check)
- API key auth (`Bearer fc_...`) for CLI/scripting use
- Login rate limiting (5 attempts per email per 15 minutes)
- Health check endpoint (no auth required)
- Docker Compose deployment
- PM2 bare-metal deployment

### What's Not Built Yet

- **Phase 2:** Puppeteer JS rendering, filesystem storage, PDF/DOCX extraction
- **Phase 3:** Job queue, multi-page site crawling, robots.txt
- **Phase 4:** Multi-user management
- **Phase 5:** RAG chunking, login-gated scraping, export formats

```

See [`ecosystem.config.cjs`](ecosystem.config.cjs) for PM2 tuning options.

## Why a VPS? (Not Netlify / Vercel)

ForgeCrawl requires a traditional server (VPS, Droplet, bare metal) and **cannot run on serverless platforms** like Netlify or Vercel. This isn't a limitation we plan to work around — it's fundamental to the architecture.

| Requirement | VPS / Droplet | Netlify / Vercel |
|---|---|---|
| **SQLite database** | Persistent disk, single-file DB, trivial backups | No persistent filesystem — DB lost on every cold start |
| **better-sqlite3** | Native C++ module, runs perfectly | Requires special bundling; synchronous I/O is an anti-pattern for serverless |
| **WAL mode** | Single long-running process, safe concurrent reads | Multiple function instances = write conflicts and corruption risk |
| **Puppeteer (Phase 2)** | Full Chrome, no size/time limits | Exceeds function size limits (~50MB zipped); cold starts are 10+ seconds |
| **Long scrapes** | No timeout constraints | 10-26 second function timeout kills slow pages |
| **File storage (Phase 2)** | Persistent disk for HTML/Markdown/chunks | Only ephemeral `/tmp` (512MB, wiped between invocations) |
| **In-memory rate limiter** | Works correctly in a single process | Each function invocation has its own memory — rate limiting is meaningless |
| **Stable process** | PM2 keeps it running with auto-restart | No persistent process; each request spins up a new instance |

**Bottom line:** ForgeCrawl is a stateful application with a local database, native modules, and long-running operations. Serverless platforms are designed for stateless, short-lived functions. You'd need to swap SQLite for a managed database (Postgres, Turso), rewrite all I/O to be async, remove native dependencies, and accept severe Puppeteer limitations — at which point it's a different application.

**Recommended hosts:** DigitalOcean Droplet ($6/mo), Hetzner VPS, AWS Lightsail, or any VPS with 1GB+ RAM and Node.js 22+. See the Docker Compose or PM2 quick starts above.

> **Note:** The marketing site (`packages/web`) deploys to Netlify as a static site — see the Marketing Site section below.

## Marketing Site

The marketing site (`packages/web`) is a separate Nuxt 4 static site with SEO, dark/light mode, and the forge aesthetic. It deploys to Netlify and lives at [forgecrawl.com](https://forgecrawl.com).

### Development

```bash
# Start marketing site dev server
pnpm dev:web
# Visit http://localhost:3200
```

### Deploy to Netlify (Static Site)

ForgeCrawl's marketing site deploys as a **fully static site** (SSG) — not a single-page app (SPA). Nuxt pre-renders every route to plain HTML at build time, so there's no server, no functions, and no client-side routing fallback needed. This is configured via `nitro: { preset: 'static' }` in `nuxt.config.ts`.

#### Option A: Automatic via `netlify.toml` (Recommended)

The repo includes `packages/web/netlify.toml` which configures everything. Just connect the repo:

1. Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com) and click **Add new site** → **Import an existing project**
2. Select your GitHub repo (`cschweda/forgecrawl`)
3. Netlify will auto-detect `packages/web/netlify.toml` — verify the settings:
   - **Base directory:** `packages/web`
   - **Build command:** `npx nuxt generate`
   - **Publish directory:** `.output/public`
   - **Node version:** 22
4. Click **Deploy site**

That's it. Every push to `main` triggers a rebuild.

#### Option B: Manual Netlify Configuration

If the `netlify.toml` isn't detected, configure manually:

1. **Add new site** → **Import an existing project** → select the repo
2. Under **Build settings**:
   - **Base directory:** `packages/web`
   - **Build command:** `npx nuxt generate`
   - **Publish directory:** `packages/web/.output/public`
3. Under **Environment variables**, add:
   - `NODE_VERSION` = `22`
4. Click **Deploy site**

#### Option C: Local Build + Manual Deploy

```bash
# Generate the static site
pnpm build:web

# The output is in packages/web/.output/public/
# This directory contains plain HTML, CSS, JS — ready to upload

# Deploy via Netlify CLI
npx netlify-cli deploy --prod --dir=packages/web/.output/public
```

#### Verify It's Static (Not SPA)

After deploying, confirm the site is fully static:

- View source on any page — you should see fully rendered HTML content, not an empty `<div id="app"></div>`
- The `netlify.toml` has **no** `/* → /index.html` rewrite (that would be SPA mode)
- Each route gets its own `index.html` in `.output/public/`

#### Custom Domain

1. In Netlify, go to **Domain management** → **Add custom domain**
2. Enter `forgecrawl.com` (or your domain)
3. Update your DNS records as instructed (either Netlify DNS or an A/CNAME record)
4. Netlify provisions a free SSL certificate automatically

### Features

- Nuxt 4 + Nuxt UI 4 (same stack as the app)
- Dark/light mode toggle (defaults to dark)
- Full SEO: Open Graph, Twitter Card, canonical URL, structured meta
- OG image (`og-image.png`) — the forge-themed banner
- Responsive design with glassmorphism cards
- Sections: Hero, Features, How It Works, API docs, Security, Get Started, Use Cases, Why Do I Need This?
- Static generation — zero server-side runtime

## API

All API endpoints except the health check require authentication via a **Bearer token** (API key) or a session cookie.

### No authentication required

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:5150/api/health
```

### Authentication: get an API key

Log into the web UI, navigate to the API Keys section, and create a key. The key (`fc_...`) is shown once — store it securely. Then use it in all requests:

```bash
# Set your API key (shown once when created)
export FC_KEY="fc_your_api_key_here"
```

### Authenticated endpoints

```bash
# Scrape a URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:5150/api/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FC_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}'

# Scrape with cache bypass
curl -X POST http://localhost:5150/api/scrape \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FC_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://example.com", "bypass_cache": true}'

# List scrapes
curl http://localhost:5150/api/scrapes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FC_KEY"

# Get scrape detail
curl http://localhost:5150/api/scrapes/{job_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FC_KEY"

# Delete a scrape
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5150/api/scrapes/{job_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FC_KEY"
```

### API key management

```bash
# Create an API key (requires session cookie from login)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5150/api/auth/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FC_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-script"}'

# List your API keys (key values are never shown — only prefixes)
curl http://localhost:5150/api/auth/api-keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FC_KEY"

# Revoke an API key
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5150/api/auth/api-keys/{key_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FC_KEY"
```

### Node.js / scripting example

```js
const FC_URL = 'http://localhost:5150'
const FC_KEY = process.env.FC_KEY

const res = await fetch(`${FC_URL}/api/scrape`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${FC_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ url: 'https://example.com' }),
})

const { markdown, title, wordCount } = await res.json()
console.log(`Scraped "${title}" (${wordCount} words)`)
```

## Configuration

Public configuration lives in [`forgecrawl.config.ts`](forgecrawl.config.ts) (single source of truth). Key settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `server.port` | 5150 | HTTP port |
| `storage.mode` | database | Where results are stored |
| `scrape.timeout` | 30000 | Page fetch timeout (ms) |
| `scrape.cacheTtl` | 3600 | Cache TTL in seconds (0 to disable) |
| `auth.sessionMaxAge` | 1296000 | JWT/cookie lifetime (15 days in seconds) |
| `rateLimit.loginMaxAttempts` | 5 | Failed logins before lockout |
| `rateLimit.loginWindowMs` | 900000 | Lockout window (15 minutes) |

Secrets go in `.env` (gitignored):

```bash
NUXT_AUTH_SECRET=         # Min 32 chars, signs JWTs
NUXT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=      # Phase 5 (site credentials encryption)
NUXT_ALERT_WEBHOOK=       # Discord/Slack webhook (optional)
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Nuxt 4 (4.3.1) |
| UI | Nuxt UI 4 |
| Database | SQLite via better-sqlite3 + Drizzle ORM (WAL mode) |
| Auth | bcrypt (12 rounds) + jose JWT (HS256) |
| Content Extraction | Mozilla Readability (with cheerio fallback) |
| HTML to Markdown | Turndown + GFM plugin |
| Process Manager | PM2 or Docker |

## Security

ForgeCrawl is designed to be deployed on a server you control, scraping arbitrary URLs from the internet. Security is not an afterthought — it's built into every layer.

### Authentication & Session Management

| Protection | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Password hashing** | bcrypt with 12 salt rounds — resistant to brute-force and rainbow table attacks |
| **JWT sessions** | HS256-signed tokens in HTTP-only, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookies — never stored in localStorage or exposed to JavaScript |
| **Constant-time verification** | Password comparison uses `bcrypt.compare` which is constant-time; login also hashes a dummy value on user-not-found to prevent timing-based user enumeration |
| **Session expiry** | Configurable JWT lifetime (default 15 days) with automatic expired-token detection and stale cookie cleanup |
| **Auth secret validation** | `NUXT_AUTH_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters; the app throws on first auth action if missing |
| **API key auth** | Bearer tokens (`fc_...`) with SHA-256 hashed storage — raw keys shown once at creation and never stored. Keys support optional expiry and are scoped to the creating user |
| **Setup lockout** | First-run admin registration (`/setup`) is permanently locked after the first admin account is created — stored in the database, not bypassable |

### Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Protection

Scraping user-supplied URLs is a high-risk operation. ForgeCrawl blocks SSRF at multiple levels:

| Layer | What it blocks |
|---|---|
| **Protocol allowlist** | Only `http:` and `https:` — blocks `file://`, `ftp://`, `gopher://`, etc. |
| **Hostname blocklist** | `localhost`, `0.0.0.0`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`, `metadata.google.internal` |
| **IP range blocklist** | Private ranges (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x), loopback, link-local (169.254.x), cloud metadata (169.254.169.254), shared address space (100.64-127.x), IPv6 private/link-local |
| **DNS resolution check** | After URL parsing, resolves the hostname and checks the resolved IP against all blocklists — prevents DNS rebinding attacks where a domain points to a private IP |
| **DNS failure = block** | If DNS resolution fails, the request is blocked rather than allowed through — prevents SSRF bypass during DNS outages |
| **Redirect re-validation** | HTTP redirects are handled manually; each redirect target is re-validated through the full SSRF pipeline before following — prevents open-redirect SSRF bypass |

### Input Validation & Injection Prevention

| Protection | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **SQL injection** | Drizzle ORM parameterized queries throughout — no raw SQL, no string concatenation |
| **XSS** | Vue template auto-escaping on all rendered content; no `v-html` usage |
| **Error message sanitization** | Internal error messages are filtered before reaching the client — only known-safe error types are passed through |
| **Rate limiting** | Login endpoint: 5 failed attempts per email per 15-minute window with automatic lockout |
| **Health endpoint** | Exposes only version, database status, and setup state — no memory usage, uptime, or server internals |

### Data Isolation

- All scrape data queries are scoped to the authenticated user's ID
- Delete operations verify ownership before execution
- No cross-user data access is possible through the API

### Known Limitations

- **No CSRF token** — SameSite=Lax cookies block cross-origin POST, which covers all mutation endpoints. Same-site subdomain attacks are not protected, but acceptable for single-server self-hosted deployment.
- **In-memory rate limiter** — resets on server restart. Acceptable for single-user deployment; persistent rate limiting via SQLite planned for a future phase.
- **Single user only** — no multi-user management until Phase 4.

## Testing

ForgeCrawl includes 81 integration tests across 10 test files, organized into four categories: **health**, **authentication**, **security**, and **scraping**. Every test runs against a real production-built server over HTTP — no mocks, no test doubles.

### Running tests

```bash
# Run all 81 tests
pnpm test

# Run individual suites
pnpm test:health      # Health check endpoint (6 tests)
pnpm test:auth        # Auth: setup, login, API keys (21 tests)
pnpm test:security    # Security: middleware, SSRF, rate limiting, error sanitization, data isolation (42 tests)
pnpm test:scrape      # Scraping: fetch, cache, CRUD (10 tests)
```

### How tests work

Tests use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with a custom global setup (`tests/setup/global-setup.ts`) that:

1. **Builds the Nuxt app** for production (`pnpm build`)
2. **Starts the server** as a child process on port 5199 with a clean, isolated test database
3. **Runs all test files** sequentially — each file uses `ofetch` to make real HTTP requests against the running server
4. **Tears down** the server process and deletes all test data when complete

This approach tests the full stack end-to-end: HTTP routing, middleware, database queries, and response formatting. Test helpers (`tests/setup/test-helpers.ts`) provide shared utilities for login, API key creation, and authenticated requests.

### Test suites overview

| Suite | File | Tests | Category |
|-------|------|:-----:|----------|
| Health Check | `01-health` | 6 | Health |
| Auth: Setup | `02-auth-setup` | 6 | Auth |
| Auth: Login | `03-auth-login` | 7 | Auth |
| Auth: API Keys | `04-auth-api-keys` | 8 | Auth |
| Security: Auth Middleware | `05-security-auth-middleware` | 10 | Security |
| Security: SSRF Protection | `06-security-ssrf` | 18 | Security |
| Security: Rate Limiting | `07-security-rate-limit` | 4 | Security |
| Security: Error Sanitization | `08-security-error-sanitization` | 4 | Security |
| Scraping | `09-scrape` | 10 | Scraping |
| Security: Data Isolation | `10-security-data-isolation` | 6 | Security |

### Detailed test descriptions

#### 01 — Health Check (6 tests)

Validates the unauthenticated `/api/health` endpoint:

- Returns `200` with `status: "ok"`
- Returns a version string and database connection status
- Returns `setup_complete` boolean (used by the UI to route to setup or login)
- Does **not** expose `memory` or `uptime` (prevents server fingerprinting)
- Confirms no authentication is required

#### 02 — Auth: Setup (6 tests)

Tests the one-time admin registration flow (`POST /api/auth/setup`):

- Rejects requests with missing email, short passwords (< 8 chars), or mismatched password confirmation — returns `400`
- Creates the admin account and sets an HTTP-only session cookie on success
- **Permanently locks the setup endpoint** after the first admin is created — all subsequent attempts return `403`, regardless of credentials
- Adapts assertions if setup was already completed by an earlier test file (order-independent)

#### 03 — Auth: Login (7 tests)

Tests credential validation and session management (`POST /api/auth/login`):

- Rejects missing fields with `400`
- Rejects wrong password and non-existent email with identical `401` responses and the same `"Invalid credentials"` message — **prevents user enumeration** (an attacker cannot determine which emails have accounts)
- Returns `200` with a `forgecrawl_session` cookie that has `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, and `Path=/` flags
- Returns user data (`email`, `role`) on successful login
- Verifies the response body never contains `passwordHash`, `password_hash`, or bcrypt hashes (`$2b$`)

#### 04 — Auth: API Keys (8 tests)

Tests Bearer token authentication lifecycle (`/api/auth/api-keys`):

- Creates an API key with the `fc_` prefix and a 64-character hex suffix (e.g., `fc_a1b2c3...`)
- Returns the raw key exactly once at creation with a warning it won't be shown again
- Rejects key creation without a `name` field
- Lists keys showing only the prefix (`fc_a1b2`) and name — **never exposes the full key or SHA-256 hash**
- Authenticates requests using `Authorization: Bearer fc_...` header
- Rejects invalid Bearer tokens and tokens with wrong prefixes with `401`
- Revokes a key via `DELETE /api/auth/api-keys/{id}` and confirms the revoked key is immediately rejected

#### 05 — Security: Auth Middleware (10 tests)

Tests the authentication middleware that protects all `/api/*` routes:

- **Public routes:** `GET /api/health` is accessible without authentication
- **Protected routes:** `GET /api/scrapes`, `GET /api/auth/me`, `POST /api/scrape`, and `GET /api/auth/api-keys` all return `401` without credentials
- Accepts both session cookie auth and Bearer token auth
- When both a Bearer token and a cookie are present, the **Bearer token takes priority** — allows API key auth even with a stale cookie
- Rejects tampered JWT cookies (`forgecrawl_session=tampered.jwt.token`) with `401`
- Rejects completely invalid cookies with `401`

#### 06 — Security: SSRF Protection (18 tests)

The largest test suite — validates that user-supplied URLs cannot be used to access internal resources:

- **Localhost/loopback:** Blocks `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `[::1]`
- **Cloud metadata:** Blocks `169.254.169.254` (AWS EC2 metadata) and `metadata.google.internal` (GCP)
- **Private IP ranges:** Blocks `10.x.x.x` (Class A), `172.16.x.x` (Class B), `192.168.x.x` (Class C)
- **Protocol allowlist:** Blocks `ftp://`, `file://`, `gopher://`, `javascript:` — only `http:` and `https:` are allowed
- **Invalid URLs:** Blocks malformed input like `not-a-valid-url`
- **Positive test:** Confirms a valid external HTTPS URL (`https://example.com`) succeeds

All blocked URLs return `400`. This prevents attackers from using the scraper to probe internal networks, read cloud instance credentials, or access services behind the firewall.

#### 07 — Security: Rate Limiting (4 tests)

Tests the login rate limiter that prevents brute-force password attacks:

- Allows the first 5 failed login attempts (each returns `401`)
- Blocks the 6th attempt with `429 Too Many Requests`
- Rate limiting is **case-insensitive** — `USER@TEST.COM` and `user@test.com` share the same counter (prevents bypass by varying case)
- Uses a unique email per test run to avoid interference with other test suites

#### 08 — Security: Error Sanitization (4 tests)

Verifies that internal server details never leak to clients:

- Scrape failures do not expose file paths (`/home/`, `/app/`, `/Users/`, `node_modules`)
- Scrape failures do not expose source file references (`.ts:`, `.js:`)
- Non-existent domain scrapes return `400` or `500` with a generic message — not raw Node.js error details
- Login errors return the **same message** for wrong-email and wrong-password cases — reconfirms no user enumeration from a different angle

#### 09 — Scraping (10 tests)

Tests the core scraping engine and result management:

- Rejects `POST /api/scrape` without a URL (`400`)
- Scrapes `https://example.com` and validates: `job_id`, `title` ("Example Domain"), Markdown with frontmatter (`---`), `wordCount > 0`, and `metadata.url`
- Validates YAML frontmatter contains `title:`, `url:`, `scraped_at:`, and `scraper: ForgeCrawl/`
- Returns `cached: true` on repeated scrape of the same URL
- Returns `cached: false` when `bypass_cache: true` is set
- Lists all scrapes for the authenticated user with `url` and `status` fields
- Gets scrape detail by ID with full Markdown content
- Returns `404` for non-existent scrape IDs
- Deletes a scrape and confirms it returns `404` afterward

#### 10 — Security: Data Isolation (6 tests)

Validates that users cannot access or modify other users' data:

- Attempting to delete a non-owned scrape returns `404` (not `403`) — prevents confirming whether a resource exists
- Attempting to view a non-owned scrape returns `404`
- Attempting to delete a non-owned API key returns `404`
- Scrape list returns only the current user's data (returns a valid array)
- API key list returns only keys belonging to the current user, all with `fc_` prefix

The deliberate use of `404` instead of `403` is a security pattern — returning `403 Forbidden` would confirm the resource exists but is owned by someone else, which leaks information.

## Phase 2: What's Next

Phase 2 adds JavaScript rendering and storage options:

- **Puppeteer integration** — shared browser instance with configurable concurrency for scraping SPAs and JS-heavy pages
- **Render mode toggle** — choose HTTP-only (fast) or Puppeteer (full JS) per scrape
- **`wait_for` selector** — wait for a specific CSS selector before extracting content
- **Browser crash recovery** — auto-restart on Puppeteer disconnect
- **Filesystem storage** — store raw HTML, Markdown, and metadata as files on disk (in addition to or instead of SQLite)
- **Storage interface abstraction** — clean swap between database, filesystem, or both
- **PDF extraction** — detect PDF content-type and extract text to Markdown
- **DOCX extraction** — detect DOCX and convert to Markdown via mammoth
- **Enhanced Markdown** — better handling of code blocks, tables, and nested structures
- **Scrape config UI** — toggle JS rendering, set wait selectors, choose storage mode
